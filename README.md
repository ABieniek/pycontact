[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/maxscheurer/pycontact.svg?token=Xyntx2ELmeydq8pgqs8t&branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.com/maxscheurer/pycontact)

**PyContact** is a GUI-based tool for rapid, versatile and customizable analysis of non-covalent interactions in molecular dynamics (MD) trajectories.

## Installation
Please find detailed installation instructions on the [project website](https://pycontact.github.io/) together
with a basic tutorial.

For interactive visualization: latest version of [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Development/Download/download.cgi?PackageName=VMD)


## Scripting
Analysis can also be performed by using PyContact as a plain python package. In this way,
you can automate analysis (reading trajectories and running contact score accumulation) from your Python script and visualize it in the GUI.

## Citation
If you use PyContact in a scientific publication, please cite:
A citation will be available soon.
